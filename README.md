Every feature is optional (Even the book itself!)

- Adds an instant crafting toggle. Enable it to craft with one click. Hold shift to craft as many as possible. Similar to [one click crafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/oneclickcrafting)

- Show the item in the alternatives list instead of their recipe, so it's easy to see what your clicking on.

- Optionally un-group items, saving you a right click. Great if you like to pin individual recipes

- Adds scrolling to the recipe book
    - Option for 'scrolling in circles' (I couldn't think of any other term). Like JEI, it will wrap back to the start when you reach the end. (And vice versa)

- Optionally unlock all recipes when you log in to a server/world.
  - This also suppresses the "Recipe Unlocked" toast when enabled
- Remove the "Bounce" animation when you unlock a new recipe.
